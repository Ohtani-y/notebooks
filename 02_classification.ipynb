        "Now imagine that you are a data scientist who needs to build a system that can automatically identify emotional states such as \"anger\" or \"joy\" that people express about your company's product on Twitter. In this chapter, we'll tackle this task using a variant of BERT called DistilBERT.footnote:[V. Sanh et al., [\"DistilBERT, a Distilled Version of BERT: Smaller, Faster, Cheaper and Lighter\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108), (2019).] The main advantage of this model is that it achieves comparable performance to BERT, while being significantly smaller and more efficient. This enables us to train a classifier in a few minutes, and if you want to train a larger BERT model you can simply change the checkpoint of the pretrained model. A _checkpoint_ corresponds to the set of weights that are loaded into a given transformer architecture.\n",

As shown in  <<hf-libraries>>, these libraries will allow us to quickly go from raw text to a fine-tuned model that can be used for inference on new tweets.

To enable the conversion, image:images/logo.png[hf,13,13] Datasets provides a `set_format()` method that allows us to change the _output format_ of the `Dataset`. Note that this does not change the underlying _data format_ (which is an Arrow table), and you can switch to another format later if needed:"

This requires significant compute, memory, and data. For this reason, character tokenization is rarely used in practice.

        "Having a large vocabulary is a problem because it requires neural networks to have an enormous number of parameters. To illustrate this, suppose we have 1 million unique words and want to compress the 1-million-dimensional input vectors to 1-thousand-dimensional vectors in the first layer of our neural network. This is a standard step in most NLP architectures, and the resulting weight matrix of this first layer would contain 1 million $\\times$ 1 thousand = 1 billion weights. This is already comparable to the largest GPT-2 model,footnote:[GPT-2 is the successor of GPT, and it captivated the public's attention with its impressive ability to generate realistic text. We'll explore GPT-2 in detail in <<chapter_summarization>>.] which has around 1.5 billion parameters in total!"

        "Naturally, we want to avoid being so wasteful with our model parameters since models are expensive to train, and larger models are more difficult to maintain. A common approach is to limit the vocabulary and discard rare words by considering, say, the 100,000 most common words in the corpus. Words that are not part of the vocabulary are classified as \"unknown\" and mapped to a shared `UNK` token. This means that we lose some potentially important information in the process of word tokenization, since the model has no information about words associated with `UNK`.\n",

On the one hand, we want to split rare words into smaller units to allow the model to deal with complex words and misspellings. On the other hand, we want to keep frequent words as unique entities so that we can keep the length of our inputs to a manageable size. The main distinguishing feature of subword tokenization (as well as word tokenization) is that it is _learned_ from the pretraining corpus using a mix of statistical rules and algorithms.\n",

The easiest way to understand how WordPiece works is to see it in action. image:images/logo.png[hf,13,13] Transformers provides a convenient `AutoTokenizer` class that allows you to quickly load the tokenizer associated with a pretrained model—we just call its `from_pretrained()` method, providing the ID of a model on the Hub or a local file path.

Next, these token encodings are converted to _token embeddings_, which are vectors living in a lower-dimensional space.
